The team lost early wickets and never quite recovered. Abhishek Sharma was the first to fall, bowled by Australian fast bowler Mitchell Starc for just 2 runs in the opening over. Australian batter Travis Head followed soon after, caught behind for a duck off medium pacer Vaibhav Arora's bowling. SRH's top order continued to falter, with Rahul Tripathi scoring 9 runs before being caught off Starc's bowling, leaving SRH at 21 for the loss of 3 wickets in the fourth over.\nSouth African Aiden Markram tried to stabilize the innings, scoring 20 runs off 23 balls, but he too fell, caught off West Indies' all-rounder Andre Russell's bowling. Nitish Kumar Reddy added 13 runs before being dismissed by fast bowler Harshit Rana, while South African Heinrich Klaasen contributed 16 runs before also falling to Rana. Shahbaz Ahmed managed 8 runs before being caught off spinner Varun Chakravarthy's bowling, and the impact player Abdul Samad was caught behind for 4 runs off Russell. Captain Pat Cummins, scored a brisk 24 off 19 balls, including two fours and a six, but his effort was cut short when he was caught off Russell's bowling. Jaydev Unadkat and Bhuvneshwar Kumar did not add much, with Unadkat out leg before wicket to Narine for 4 and Kumar remaining not out on 0.\nKKR's bowling attack was led by Andre Russell, who claimed 3 wickets for 19 runs. Mitchell Starc took 2 wickets for 14 runs, while Harshit Rana matched Starc with 2 wickets for 24 runs. Sunil Narine and Varun Chakravarthy each picked up a wicket, conceding 16 and 9 runs respectively. SRH's innings included 13 extras, but their overall run rate of 6.10 was insufficient at the end.\n\n\n=== Kolkata Knight Riders innings ===\nKolkata Knight Riders (KKR) was off to a quick start despite losing West Indian Sunil Narine early. Narine scored a quick 6 off 2 balls before being caught by Shahbaz Ahmed off captain Pat Cummins' bowling in the second over. This brought Venkatesh Iyer to the crease, who, alongside opener Afghan batter Rahmanullah Gurbaz, took control of the chase. Gurbaz scored 39 runs off 32 balls, including five fours and two sixes before eventually being dismissed in the ninth over, out leg before wicket by Shahbaz Ahmed, owing to a lack of Ball-Tracking and Ultra-edge. Iyer continued his innings after the loss of Gurbaz, reaching his fifty off just 24 balls. Shreyas Iyer, the KKR captain, joined him at the crease and contributed 6 off 3 balls, helping reach the target with more than nine overs to spare.\nIndian medium pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar conceded 25 runs in his 2 overs, while T. Natarajan gave away 29 runs in his 2 overs. Shahbaz Ahmed managed to pick up the wicket of Gurbaz, finishing with figures of 1 wicket for 22 in 2.3 overs. Pat Cummins was the only other wicket-taker, claiming Narine's wicket and ending with figures of 1 wicket for 18 runs in his 2 overs.\nKKR ended with a decisive victory by 8 wickets securing their third IPL title.\n\n\n=== Scorecard ===\nSource: ESPNcricinfo\n\n1st innings\n\nFall of wickets: 2–1 (Abhishek, 0.5 ov), 6–2 (Head, 1.6 ov), 21–3 (Tripathi, 4.2 ov), 47–4 (Reddy, 6.6 ov), 62–5 (Markram, 10.2 ov), 71–6 (Shahbaz, 11.5 ov), 77–7 (Samad, 12.4 ov), 90–8 (Klaasen, 14.1 ov), 113–9 (Unadkat, 17.5 ov), 113–10 (Cummins, 18.3 ov)\n\n2nd innings\n\nFall of wickets: 11–1 (Narine, 1.2 ov), 102–2 (Gurbaz, 8.5 ov)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nScorecard at ESPNcricinfo",
